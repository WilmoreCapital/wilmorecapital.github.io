I grew up in a Real Estate family. In fact, Gottsacker mean's "God's Acre" or "God's Land"...real estate is quite literally in our family design. Since 1946, the Gottsacker Family has been offering real estate services in America, and I am proud to follow in this tradition with eXP Realty and my own lending brokerage in Wilmore Capital. Having lived and traveled abroad, and owning and investing in properties in several countries, I know the importance of feeling "HOME" and having the financial support and advice to reach those goals. I've learned a lot over the years...through the languages, cultures, and life experiences. In sharing these learnings, I will educate and support you in your investments in acquiring property for your home or as an investment vehicle...after all, it's in my name.
